A reproducible machine-learning pipeline that predicts at-risk students **early** (at multiple points across a course), **explains** every prediction with SHAP and LIME, and **quantifies the stability** of those explanations — all on the public Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD). This repository accompanies the DSP391m Data Science Capstone Project at FPT University.

## 1. Motivation

Failure and drop-out remain persistent problems in Virtual Learning Environments, while the behavioural data captured by Learning Management Systems is largely under-used for timely intervention. Existing predictive models exhibit three recurring limitations:

- **Opacity.** The strongest models behave as black boxes, so instructors cannot see *why* a student is flagged and therefore cannot act with confidence.
- **Lateness.** Most studies predict at end-of-course, when intervention is no longer effective.
- **Class imbalance.** In the literature the at-risk class is usually a minority that models drift away from. Under this project's label mapping ({Fail, Withdrawn} vs {Pass, Distinction}) it is in fact a slight majority on OULAD — 52.8% of enrolments, imbalance ratio 1.12 — so imbalance handling is studied here as a controlled robustness question (RQ3), not as rescuing a rare class.

A concept-centric review of 27 representative papers (2019–2026) shows that *time-aware prediction*, *explainable AI*, and *imbalance handling* have each been studied in isolation but are rarely integrated — and never simultaneously on OULAD. This project targets exactly that empty cell.

## 2. Research Questions

| ID  | Question |
| --- | --- |
| **RQ1** | At different course-progress checkpoints (10–100% of course length), which algorithm gives the best at-risk prediction on OULAD, and how early can a prediction be considered reliable? |
| **RQ2** | How consistent are the explanations produced by SHAP and LIME for the same model, and how does their stability change across time and across imbalance-handling strategies? |
| **RQ3** | How does imbalance handling (SMOTE / ADASYN / class weighting) affect both predictive accuracy and explanation quality? |

## 3. Contributions

1. **An integrated time-aware XAI framework** that couples checkpoint-based prediction with SHAP/LIME explanations at each checkpoint — not previously done end-to-end on OULAD.
2. **An extended OULAD benchmark** adding ensemble methods (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM) to the comparison that Tomasevic et al. (2020) did not include.
3. **A quantitative explanation-stability metric** (Jaccard top-*k* agreement and standard deviation of feature importance across seeds), addressing the qualitative-only gap noted in prior reviews.
4. **An optional instructor dashboard** that turns predictions into a practical early-warning tool.

## 4. Dataset

This project uses the **Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD)** (Kuzilek et al., 2017).

| --- | --- |
| Enrolments (student × module-presentation) | 32,593 (28,785 distinct students) |
| Module-presentations | 22 |
| Relational tables | 7 |
| Feature groups | Demographics · Engagement (VLE clickstream) · Performance (assessments) |
| Target | `final_result` mapped to a binary label: **at-risk** = {Fail, Withdrawn}, **not-at-risk** = {Pass, Distinction} |

## 6. Methodology

The workflow follows the **CRISP-DM** lifecycle and is organised into six phases, each producing an independently assessable deliverable.

| Phase | Focus | Key output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Data Preparation** | Merge the 7 OULAD tables into a master table; standardise the 3 feature groups; build the at-risk label; slice data at 6 checkpoints. | `master_raw.parquet`, six checkpoint datasets |
| **2. Benchmarking** | Compare LR, RF, XGBoost, LightGBM, ANN with repeated 5-fold cross-validation (5 seeds). | Model leaderboard (F1, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, at-risk recall) |
| **3. Time-Aware Prediction** | Re-run the benchmark at each checkpoint → performance-vs-progress curve; locate the earliest reliable checkpoint **(RQ1)**. | Performance curves |
| **4. Imbalance Handling** | Compare no-resampling / class-weighting / SMOTE / ADASYN; measure the effect on accuracy *and* explanations **(RQ3)**. | Imbalance-strategy comparison |
| **5. XAI Layer** | SHAP (global + local) and LIME (local); quantify stability via Jaccard top-*k* and feature-importance std across seeds **(RQ2)**. | Explanation-stability report |
| **6. Dashboard (optional)** | Streamlit/Flask app: at-risk list + local SHAP explanation + intervention hints. | Instructor dashboard |

**Leakage prevention** is treated as a first-class concern: temporal cuts retain only records that exist before each checkpoint; the test set is fixed across all six checkpoints; and every component that learns from data (encoders, scaler, resampling) is fit on the training fold only.

## 7. Getting Started

> 🇻🇳 **Thành viên:** xem hướng dẫn từng bước (clone → tải data → sinh đủ `.parquet`) tại **[`SETUP_VI.md`](SETUP_VI.md)**.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or later
- `git`

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<org-or-user>/time-aware-xai-oulad.git
cd time-aware-xai-oulad

# 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Obtain the data

```bash
# Download the seven OULAD CSVs from the official source or the Kaggle mirror,
# then place them under data/raw/ (the directory is git-ignored):
#   assessments.csv  courses.csv  studentAssessment.csv  studentInfo.csv
#   studentRegistration.csv  studentVle.csv  vle.csv
#
# Verify integrity against the committed reference checksums (either way works):
python setup_raw_data.py
md5sum -c data/oulad_md5_reference.txt
```

### Reproduce the pipeline

```bash
# Build everything from the raw CSVs (each step is resumable / idempotent)
python -m src.data.build_master_table
python -m src.data.make_checkpoints
python -m src.evaluation.make_split --materialise   # reuses the committed test ids (guarded)
python -m src.modeling.train                        # 5 models x 6 checkpoints (resumable)

# Or narrated via the notebooks (Restart & Run All is idempotent)
jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute notebooks/01_build_master_table.ipynb

# Run the automated leakage/split test suite
pytest tests/

# Launch the instructor early-warning dashboard (Phase 6a)
streamlit run dashboard/app.py          # python dashboard/app.py --smoke for a UI-less check
```

## 8. Reproducibility

This project is designed so that an external reader can reproduce every result:

- **Deterministic seeds** are fixed throughout (`RANDOM_SEED = 42`).
- **Data provenance** is pinned by the committed `data/oulad_md5_reference.txt` (md5 per raw file); `setup_raw_data.py` verifies every download against it and records a local manifest.
- **Frozen split guard.** `data/splits/test_student_ids.csv` is the committed source of truth; `make_split` always reuses it, and re-derivation requires the explicit `--rederive` flag (a whole-team decision — fold assignment drifts across sklearn versions).
- **Environment** is pinned in `requirements.txt` and `environment.yml` (working set verified 2026-07-12 against the committed model bundles).
- **Notebooks** execute top-to-bottom without manual intervention (`Restart & Run All`).
- **Automated tests** (`tests/test_leakage.py`) guard against temporal leakage at all six checkpoints, train-only preprocessing statistics, the feature allow-list and the split guard.

## 10. Project Status

**Report 2 — Data Tasks (collection, cleaning, EDA): complete.** The full data pipeline (`src/data`, `src/features`, `src/eda`, `src/evaluation`) builds the master table (32,593 × 33), six time-aware checkpoint datasets, and the leakage-safe split harness; the automated leakage/split test suite (`tests/test_leakage.py`) passes; EDA figures, result tables and the bilingual documentation set live under `reports/` and `docs/`. Every work item (STT 1–40) and its artifact are mapped in [`docs/README_EN.md`](docs/README_EN.md) (Vietnamese: `docs/README_VI.md`).

**Phase 2–3 — Benchmarking + Time-Aware Prediction: complete.** The five candidate algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, ANN) are benchmarked across all six checkpoints with a leakage-safe held-out test and repeated 5-fold × 5-seed cross-validation at t=100% (`src/modeling/train.py`). XGBoost leads; at-risk prediction meets the reliability bar (recall ≥ 0.80) from the **40% checkpoint** on the full enrolment cohort, while on the actionable still-enrolled cohort it reaches the bar only at course end (see `reports/tables/sensitivity_active_xgb.csv`) — both cohorts are reported (RQ1). Results: `reports/tables/{model_metrics,cv_summary,time_aware_best}.csv` and the `time_aware_*` / `model_benchmark` figures.

**Phase 4–5 — Imbalance Handling + XAI: artifacts in place.** Phase 4 compares no-resampling / class-weighting / SMOTE / ADASYN at t=100%: all four strategies differ only marginally on every accuracy metric (`reports/tables/imbalance_comparison.csv`), and the *explanation* half of RQ3 confirms the same robustness — high pairwise SHAP-ranking correlation for every strategy pair (`reports/tables/xai_stability_strategies.csv`). The benchmark pipeline therefore retains the proposal's SMOTE step, a choice the comparison shows to be immaterial; the Phase-2 progress deck reports the no-resampling baseline rows. Phase 5 delivers SHAP/LIME explanations and their seed/checkpoint stability metrics (`reports/tables/xai_*.csv` + figures).

**Hardening & audit pass (2026-07-12): complete.** Two independent audits were cross-verified and remediated: the frozen split is guarded in code, decision thresholds are now chosen on out-of-fold validation and applied to the held-out test exactly once (`reports/tables/threshold_validation.csv` — the validation-chosen cuts transfer with almost no change), per-subgroup fairness metrics are published (`reports/tables/fairness_subgroups.csv`; max recall gap 6.6 pp on `imd_band`), a banked-assessment flag bug was fixed with a regression test (78/32,593 rows), and raw-data checksums are pinned. The full narrative, per-member Q&A and the pre-submission renumber checklist live in [`reports/guide/SO_TAY_BAO_VE_VI.md`](reports/guide/SO_TAY_BAO_VE_VI.md) (process log: `reports/guide/_process_log_2026-07-12.md`). **Phase 6 — Dashboard + report assembly: in progress.** The Streamlit early-warning dashboard is implemented (`dashboard/app.py`: ranked at-risk list per checkpoint, still-enrolled filter, per-student SHAP explanation labelled with its checkpoint; smoke-tested end-to-end). The Introduction + Literature Review + IEEE references are drafted (`reports/final_report/1_Introduction_and_Literature_Review_EN.md`), and the section-by-section assembly map for the final Word report is at `reports/final_report/00_ASSEMBLY_MAP_VI.md`. Remaining before submission: assemble the final report, sign the Step-0 minutes, and run the renumber checklist.

"""Aggregate assessment submissions (studentAssessment) into performance features,
computed *as of a cutoff day* (so it works for the master table at t=100% and for
every checkpoint).

Per student-module-presentation:
    n_assessments_submitted  - submissions with date_submitted <= cutoff
    mean_score_to_date        - mean score of those submissions
    weighted_score_to_date    - sum(score * weight / 100) of those submissions
    not_submitted             - 1 if >=1 assessment whose deadline already passed
                                (deadline <= cutoff) was neither submitted by cutoff
                                nor covered by a banked (carried-over) result.

`aggregate_performance` MUST be pure and cutoff-driven. `not_submitted`
distinguishes a genuine miss from "no deadline yet", so filling missing scores
with 0 downstream stays meaningful.

# Preprocessing Sequence: Split â†’ Fit â†’ Transform â†’ Resample

*The order of operations that prevents test-set information from leaking into training*

**DSP391m â€“ Group 5 Â· Report 2 (Data Tasks), Chapter 3 Â· Work item STT 22 (vanson)**
*Implemented in `src/features/preprocessing.py`.*

## 1. The core principle

Every component that **learns** from data â€” imputation statistics, encoders, the scaler, and any resampler â€” must be **fit on the training fold only** and then **applied** (transform) to the test set. Fitting on the full dataset before splitting leaks test-set statistics (means, category sets, class structure) into training and yields optimistic, non-reprovansonible estimates.

## 2. The sequence

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["master_raw / dataset_t"] --> B["1. SPLIT (group-aware + stratified)\nby id_student, fixed test set"]
    B --> C["2. handle_missing\nfit logic on TRAIN, apply to both"]
    C --> D["3. handle_outliers\nlog1p / winsorize, thresholds from TRAIN"]
    D --> E["4. ColumnTransformer.fit(TRAIN)\nscaler + ordinal + one-hot + binary"]
    E --> F["4b. transform(TRAIN) and transform(TEST)"]
    F --> G["5. RESAMPLE (SMOTE/ADASYN)\nTRAIN ONLY â€” never the test set"]
    G --> H["Model training / evaluation"]
```

ASCII form (for environments without Mermaid):

```
 master_raw / dataset_t
        |
 [1] SPLIT  (StratifiedGroupKFold by id_student; fixed 20% test set)
        |
 [2] handle_missing   -> impute logic learned on TRAIN, applied to TRAIN+TEST
        |
 [3] handle_outliers  -> log1p / winsorize; thresholds from TRAIN
        |
 [4] ColumnTransformer.fit(TRAIN)  -> StandardScaler + Ordinal + OneHot + Binary
        |
 [4b] transform(TRAIN), transform(TEST)
        |
 [5] RESAMPLE (SMOTE / ADASYN)  -> TRAIN ONLY
        |
 model.fit(TRAIN_resampled) ; evaluate on TEST
```

## 3. Why each step sits where it does

| Step | Anti-leakage reason |
|---|---|
| 1. Split first | Nothing is learned before the test set is separated, so no statistic can flow from test to train. |
| 2. Missing | `imd_band â†’ "Unknown"`; assessment gaps â†’ 0 plus the `not_submitted` flag; `date_registration` â†’ **train** median. |
| 3. Outliers | `log1p` for right-skewed clickstream features; `winsorize` thresholds learned per fold; **no rows dropped**. |
| 4. Encode + scale | `StandardScaler`, `OrdinalEncoder`, `OneHotEncoder`, `BinaryEncoder` are **fit on train only**; `scaler.mean_` is computed from train and printed as evidence. |
| 5. Resample | SMOTE/ADASYN run **inside the training fold only**; the test set must reflect the real class distribution, so it is never resampled. |

## 4. Evidence of correctness

- `scaler.mean_` is derived solely from the training fold (printed by `fit_transform_train`).
- The test set is transformed with `.transform()` only â€” never `.fit()` / `.fit_transform()`.
- Resampling is applied after transforming, on `X_train` only.

This ordering is the practical embodiment of the leakage-prevention rules (STT 12) on the **feature** axis, complementing the **time** axis enforced by `cut_at_checkpoint`.
